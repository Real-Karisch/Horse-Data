TACITUS brushed with WAR OF WIILL springing from the starting gate, settled into stride and into midpack,\\n',\n ' raced three wide around the clubhouse bend, was rated proceeding along the backstretch, tipped to the outside coming up to its conclusion, wound up on\\n',\n ' the overland route making his way on the far turn, got called upon leaving the five-sixteenths marker, bumped with WAR OF WILL as they spun into stretch\\n',\n ' directly abreast of each other, shifted closer to the rail when rein-ridden traversing through the furlong grounds, was taken hold and maneuvered back into\\n',\n ' path five at the eighth pole, gained ground in a steadfast manner to garner the place. JOEVIA broke in line with TAX, established the top by the crown of the\\n',\n ' opening bend, showed the way with the aforementioned rival in attendance to the outside, was put to the test by that opponent nearing the quarter pole and\\n',\n ' was turned loose, offered resistance before yielding to the winner in midlane, weakened into the show slot. TAX hand urged from the gate, was taken hold\\n',\n ' once JOEVIA assumed control, prompted the pace two to three wide, bid for the top as the field stepped into the stretch, wandered out four wide during the\\n',\n \" ensuing furlong, wasn't up to the task at hand and weakened. MASTER FENCER (JPN) rode the rail until the half mile pole, responded when let out a\\n\",\n ' notch, working his way into path three by midpoint, paused at the five-sixteenths pole then proceeded to shift six wide from that station to the\\n',\n ' three-sixteenths pole, rallied mildly mainly improving position. SPINOFF strung out three wide on both turns, lacked the necessary stretch response.\\n',\n ' EVERFAST loosely pocketed to the half mile pole, was wedged in between rivals two wide on the second bend, swung into the lane, failed to make the\\n',\n ' necessary headway and retreated in the last eighth. INTREPID HEART brushed at the start after losing his footing, raced two to three wide to the quarter\\n',\n ' pole, stepped into the stretch under a ride and had no rally. WAR OF WILL made light contact with TACITUS after losing his footing as the field was sent off\\n',\n ' and running, was in path four making his way on the first turn, was still in same path in pursuit of the front runners, the widest of all, and without benefit of\\n',\n ' cover, departed the backstretch once again stationed in the four path, got cued up approaching the quarter pole, turned into the lane in tight quarters with\\n',\n ' the second place finisher, resulting in a solid bump between them, kept up its pursuit for a little while longer before faltering. BOURBON WAR unhurried\\n',\n ' during the initial stages sitting at the back of the pack in the two path, failed to reach a contending position.\\n',\n ' Denotes a Keeneland Sales Graduate\\n',\n ' Copyright 2020 Equibase Company LLC.
