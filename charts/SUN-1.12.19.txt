   SUNNY KAT caught three wide early, dictated terms up the backstretch, shifted in by the three-eighths, asked for run still on a clear margin nearing the
   quarter pole, responded by drawing off. FIRE POWER raced forwardly between rivals early, continued the pursuit outside then inside a foe and scrubbed
   along midway on the far turn, was no match for the winner but held second over. PLENTY PATRIOTIC , who switched outside a rival entering the first turn
   and settled at the rear, came into the stretch four wide, missed second. AWESOME K P tracked in behind last but one, advanced three to four wide on the
   far turn, flattened out in the lane. SPRING LOADED pressed the continued to pursue the pace of the eventual winner inside, weakened.

   Footnotes
   CLOUD HARBOR pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn, angled in through the turn, drifted out in early stretch and held for the win. TIZA
   ROLL set a pressured early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out in early stretch, was carried out and finshed second best. DOM JUAN
   raced in mid pack early, went five wide into the turn and was along for the show position. CRY SUMMATION was taken back early, advanced seven wide
   through the turn and flattened out. HAPPY FORTY EIGHT stalked the early pace from the inside, angled out in early stretch and faded. EASY TOPPER was
   void of any early speed, went six wide into the turn and never fired. LAURAS INDIANMUSIC was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals and tired.
   CHACHAS SPECIAL was unhurried early from the inside and offered no late rally. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE SIX FURLONG TIME WAS
   UNAVAILABLE.

   DUBLINSWILDBERRYwasintightatthebreakandintheearlygoing,switchedoutside a foe, advanced outside rivals leaving the backstretch going four to
   three wide into the turn, took over a narrow lead about the five-sixteenths, kicked clear in upper stretch, held safe. CURLINA CURLINA was in tight at the
   start, outpaced early, came six wide into the stretch and gained the place. IT'S ABOUT ALEX broke outwardly then steadied in tight quarters at the start,
   movedupthreeto four wide on the turn, lost the place late. TOPAZ JEWEL broke outwardly, pressed briefly inside, lost ground and shifted out for the drive,
   kept on in the lane. EASY TARGET pressed then took a narrow lead from about the seven-sixteenths to the five-sixteenths, weakened in the stretch.
   SUFFICIENT GRACE was forced out a bit at the start, chased in behind first off the fence then shifted in, ran on evenly. DAYLIGHT CHARGER showed
   brief speed then soon dropped back. BOBSINDIANROSE, very reluctant to load, chased six to seven wide, came up empty. EMPIRE ZONE showed very
   brief speed but soon dropped back. RUN NANCY SUE was fractious in the gate, had a saddle adjustment, was in tight at the break and never a threat.

   RIGTIMEstalked from inside a rival then applied pressure into the turn, took a narrow lead in upper stretch and forged clear late. BIG HITTER set the pace
   off the rail, vied briefly inside the eventual winner in upper stretch then yielded late. STORMING BACK stalked from outside a foe off the leading trio, failed
   to rally on the top pair but captured show honors. GOLLY GEE raced inside early, came out in the stretch and passed a tired rival. ALMOST A STORM was
   within range four wide through the turn but empty in the lane. STORM THE BEACH never fired. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS

   Footnotes
   DUBDUBWATSON tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, dueled with BLACK OPS through the stretch,
   exchanged bumps with that rival and prevailed for the win. BLACK OPS pressed the early pace, went three wide into the turn, met the bid of the winner at
   the quarter pole, drifted out in early stretch, exchanged bumps and finished second best. OFFICER GRIGGS was allowed to settle early, raced between
   rivals into the turn, angled in and was along for the show position. FLASHAWAY was unhurried early, went five wide into the turn and never fired. DYNAMIC
   RULER was void of any early speed, circled seven wide through the turn and offered no late rally. ZIPTIME raced in mid pack early, advanced along the
   inside and faded. WESTMONT set a pressured early pace, raced along the inside into the turn and gave way.

   through the far turn and into upper stretch, put that rival away to edge clear late under steady handling. STORM WIND CHASER stalked the pace from
   outside, moved forward between the pacesetter and the aforementioned into the far turn to challenge for the lead, yielded in late stretch. TRUST THE VAN

   turn, was no match for the top two but annexed show honors. TUCKER D was in a bit tight at the break, tracked in behind just off the fence, shifted six wide
   into the stretch and gained some late. NAVARONE SANTASONG was held up between rivals through the first turn, continued to track in behind off the rail,
   ran on evenly. POPATOPPRO set the pace, faced pressure from outside through the far turn, faltered. GO CHAMP GO failed to menace. WILD
