    SPECTACULAR STORM angled in and trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground into the lane, rallied from the inside and drew clear. SIX
    EIGHTEEN set the pace with pressure from CHARMING WEEKEND on the outside, cleared foe and traveled two wide exiting the turn, urged through the
    lane but was overtaken by the winner. CHARMING WEEKEND away quickly at the start, pressed the pace from the outside, three wide around the turn and
    weakened in the final furlong. EMPRESS SONGBIRD stalked the top pair, two to three wide around the turn and never responded when asked. COACH

   wide on the turn and held the place. DERBY TANGO chased between rivals, bumped PROUD DREAM entering the turn, raced near the inside to the stretch
   and never rallied. LOONAR SECRETS off slow to begin, lugged out on the backstretch, came back to the inside then angled out on the turn and could not
   rally. CHIRIPA off slow, took the turn three wide and weakened. PROUD DREAM up close along the inside, bumped and checked entering the turn, raced
   two wide to the lane and weakened. The Stewards disqualified DERBY TANGO from third to last for bumping PROUD DREAM entering the turn.

   OURNATIONspedclearofthefield, drifted out into the lane and drew away. WHO'S HOT chased from the inside, lacked a late bid but held onto the place.
   LION'S LUCK chased outside a rival, three to four wide entering the stretch and missed the place. SENOR PEGASUS angled over to the inside, traveled
   along the rail to the stretch and was never a factor.
