   pressed early three deep shaking clear on the far turn, engaged from the inside in upper stretch would cede when weary late. COPPER TRAIL pressed
   early between horses then inside of foe to the far turn, ceded there chasing to upper stretch weakening the final eighth finishing evenly. SPIT'S IMAGE slow
   early mustered a mild rally in the four path the last eighth to best the others. PALI'S REWARD was in tight and steadied after the break, launched a bold
   three wide bid on the far turn then flattened out in upper stretch. BROOKLYNNS PRIDE played no factor. SHE'SALLRIGHT pressed the early pace inside
   then wilted on the far turn. PAIG'S SONG veered out at the break, was never involved.

    RICH E Z unhurried early fired out of the far turn dueling up gamely from between horses at the wire. ARBITRATOR tracked evenly through the far turn
    saving ground to upper stretch bidding gamely along the rail. EASY INDYGO slow early circled out on the far turn coming five wide in upper stretch bidding
    willingly late near mid track. MAGIC APPLE veered brushing the gate at the break, gave a prompted middle move chasing on the far turn, pressed near mid
    track in upper stretch before weakening late. DISCREETLY FIRM sent clear was rated on lead through the far turn, hooked in upper stretch would wear
    down. FEE WAIVER saved ground playing no factor. BLANKET OF ICE raced mid pack tiring in upper stretch. ONE WAY TO FAME stalked the pace
    hanging in through the far turn then wilted in upper stretch.

   MUSIAL slow early angled to the rail on the turn firing in upper stretch powering off late. GRANDSON SLAM rallied on the turn bidding boldly in upper
   stretch ceding to inside pressure while saving place. INTERNATIONAL MAN sent clear set the pace through the turn, hooked between horses in upper
   stretch would drift out while weakening. WE BE BURNIN slow early was outrun to upper stretch passing tired ones late. SIN PROBLEMA a step slow was
   hustled off the pace, raced evenly the final eighth. DRAMA STAR gave hard pursuit through the turn then tired in upper stretch. MR. BOOGEDY chased
   through the turn then gave way the final eighth. CLASSY NEKIA played no factor. SLICK SIX faded on the turn. FOREVER SINGING was always outrun.
